# How to Install

Built with NodeJS v16.15.0 and npm v8.5.5 to build the apps. You need Docker, Docker-compose and Makefile available in your machine. Then, you only need to clone the repo and run `make infra`. This command will setup docker containers related to the api, mongodb instance, minio instance, and an admin user: email:`root@root.com` , password:`rootadmin`. After this, you can hit the following url:  `http://localhost:3333/health-check`. 

if return a successful message, you are ready to go.

You can also:
- attach to logs with `make attach_logs`
- stop with `make stop`
- start with `make up`
- remove with `make destroy`

# How to Use

Before proceeding, make sure that the services are running.

You can see the swagger page with the following URL: `http://localhost:3333/docs`

Besides that, I made a Postmanâ€™s collection with all the endpoints available, you can find them in the directory `./docs.

To upload customer image, you use the signedUrl received from `PATCH /customers/{customerId}/photo`. Make a PUT request with file as multipart/form-data. You can easily do that in the postman collection.



# How to Run Tests

Until now, Only auth routes have been covered with integration tests. You can run it with `npm run test:integration`

# How to Deploy

You can build a docker image from the Dockerfile and run the container with the following env vars:
```bash
